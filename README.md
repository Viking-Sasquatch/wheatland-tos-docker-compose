# wheatland-tos-docker-compose

The wheatland-tos-docker-compose project is a docker-compose project which
will allow a developer to spin up the entire stack of Wheatland's TOS 2 for
development and debugging.

This adds a local SQL Server and local Active Directory server to avoid the
slowness of developing and debugging remotely in Wheatland's environment.
